### Meshing With Voice

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A quick voice and face-me(a)sh-up in the browser, inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac7MSo9nMiI
Uses [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/), the pretrained [Facemesh model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh) and voice recognition via the [Web Speech API](https://caniuse.com/#search=Web%20Speech%20API)

Wait until it has loaded and then say something.

Demo: **TBD**

* Webcam and Microphone permissions required
* Must run in a secure context (https)
* *Chrome only* as of [Web Speech API](https://caniuse.com/#search=Web%20Speech%20API)
